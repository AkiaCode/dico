## Quick Example

import dico


client = dico.Client("YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", intents=dico.Intents.full())


@client.on_("MESSAGE_CREATE")
async def on_message_create(message: dico.MessageCreate):
    if message.content.startswith("!hello"):
        # This request part will be improved later.
        await client.http.create_message(message.channel_id, "Hello, World!", *[None for x in range(5)])


client.run()
```
